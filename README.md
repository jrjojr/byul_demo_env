# 🌟 Byul's World DEMO 0.1 – NPC Pathfinding Simulator

**Byul's World DEMO 0.1** is a lightweight real-time simulator
where multiple NPCs set their own goals and navigate a 2D grid map.
It visually demonstrates how NPCs follow their paths dynamically.

The pathfinding algorithm is based on `D* Lite`,
implemented in C and wrapped using CFFI for direct control in Python.

## 💬 Developer Note

This project is an experiment to create a world
where NPCs live with purpose, memory, and routine.
What started as a simple pathfinding simulator
will grow into a living village simulation.
